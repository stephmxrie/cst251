	<p>The goal of this lab was to understand css colors, know the different color codes.
		Another part was styling text elements by transforming and decorating. </p>
	<center><p class="over"><h2><div id="challenge">Problems</div></p></h2></center>
	<p>My main challenge was adding Google Fonts. I had some trial and error having the font show up.
	With double checking my code and looking at the lecture notes I was able to have it work.</p>
	<center><p class="over"><h2><div id="challenge">Results</div><p></h2></center>
	<p>My main focus was to use google fonts in this lab and play with color.
		I like to take hex codes from the background using photoshop and add it to my lab.
	I am happy with how the page looks and I like how my text came out. I would like to work
on styling pages with complex formating.</p>
