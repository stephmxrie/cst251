<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
<h2>Objective:</h2>
<p>The lab focused on creating file structures. File structures consists of directories, folders, and files. With learning the difference
between these three we also learned how to understand the layout template and create and expand the overall layout.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Directories:</b> a placeholder for all folders</li>
  <li><b>Folder:</b> contains other folders and files, mostly subfolders  </li>
  <li><b>File:</b> contains data (.html, .jpeg, etc)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges:</h2>
<p>The lab was overall easy to understand and comprehend. Most of the labs usually correspond with the lecture, therefore the difficiulty is minimal.
Along with learning file structures we also learned how to add pictures. Adding pictures was an easy task, however, the difficulty is to make sure how
to write file names down verbatim and make sure you have the right file type. (.jpeg, .png)</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<h3>Look, pictures!</h3>
