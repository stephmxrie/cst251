		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>This lab was challenging because we had to copy a website based on a screenshot,
			without being able to use any code from the website.
		</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>Formatting was the biggest problem and finding the fonts that were identical.
		Another problem was figuring out text spacing. I could not get it to be as spot on as I wanted.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Take a look!</p>
