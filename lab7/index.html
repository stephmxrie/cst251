<h2>Challenge</h2>
</center>
<p>The biggest challenge we had to face was how to start CSS. Last lab we were able to start CSS coding by using a template Wes gave us. Instead of just going off that
template, I decided to inspect Wes's Lab 7 website on github. There I was able to understand how Wes coded on his webpage. I used that as a template and started tweaking the
CSS to my liking. What was hard was how to start the CSS and how to add to it without messing it up.</p>

<p>The biggest problem I faced when doing this lab as how to add images in CSS. I was trying to add a picture as a background like Wes did on Lab 7. However,
it would not work for me. I am not sure if I misunderstood the code or was writing the css for images wrong, but the picture was not going as a background.
Even when I was able to make the picture show up, it would not show up as a background, it would show up as a box in one of the sections. I was not able to put
as a file.  </p>

<p>I was able to add a background! I decided just to do a repeating background with a selfie I used in a previous lab. However, since I was having coding issues, I
decided just use imgur. Imgur is an online image sharing program, I just used the image link as my background since it is public.</p>
