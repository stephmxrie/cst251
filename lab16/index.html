		<h2>Lab 15: Fancy CSS 2</h2>
		<h2>Challenges, Problems & Results</h2>
	The goal of this lab was to incorporate more CSS into our website. This focused on Fancy CSS
			that includes more backgrounds, transitions, animations and columns.

The only problem I had was trying to figure out a theme and make sure
			the elements I have aligned with what I was going for. I was not sure how to include the transition elements
		because they are very basic.</p>


	Check out the results and take a look!
