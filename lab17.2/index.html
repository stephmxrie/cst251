  <h2>Lab 17: Float Layout</h2>


  <h1>Challenges</h1>

The lab was to create different CSS layout. We were supposed to create our regular file,
 our float layout and flexbox layout. As a bonus we were also able to create a grid layout. The goal of this lab was
 to create something new and even design it out.

<h1> Problems </h1>
<p>

I only did float and flexbox because I am not used to this and had to use W3 schools a lot. The problem I found was
how to initally start this lab because the last lecture was went over remotely. I don't think I got all the information
I needed via zoom which is my error.
