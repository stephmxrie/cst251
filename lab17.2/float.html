  <h1>Lab 17: CSS Flexbox</h1>

<h1>Challenges, Problems & Results</h1>

The lab was to create different CSS layout. We were supposed to create our regular file,
 our float layout and flexbox layout. As a bonus we were also able to create a grid layout.

<p>

I only did float and flexbox because I am not used to this and had to use W3 schools a lot. The problem I found was
how to initally start this lab because the last lecture was went over remotely.
